Data - The dataset (daily-total-female-births.csv) contains historical data on daily female births in California over 12 months in 1959, with 365 observations.

Analysis - The project involves the following steps: Data loading and preprocessing. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the dataset. Time series modeling using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average). Model evaluation and performance metrics calculation. Forecast generation for future time periods based on historical data. Visualization of results and insights derived from the analysis.

**Results - ** The project generates accurate forecasts for the daily number of female births in California, providing insights into trends, seasonality, and overall patterns in birth rates. Evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are computed to assess the performance of the forecasting models.
